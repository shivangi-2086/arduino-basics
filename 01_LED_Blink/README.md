# Arduino Basics

This repository contains beginner-level Arduino programs developed as part of learning
Internet of Things (IoT) fundamentals through simulation.

## Tools Used
- Arduino (Simulation)
- Tinkercad Circuits

## Programs
- **LED Blinking**
  - Demonstrates basic digital output control
  - Includes Arduino sketch (`led_blink.ino`)
  - Circuit simulated and tested in Tinkercad

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding Arduino program structure (`setup()` and `loop()`)
- Working with digital I/O pins
- Simulation-based testing without physical hardware
