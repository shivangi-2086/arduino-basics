# Arduino Basics – IoT Learning Repository

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in Arduino and Embedded Systems as part of my Internet of Things (IoT) coursework and self-study.

The projects focus on core embedded concepts such as digital I/O, timing, sensor interfacing, and simulation-based testing using Arduino.

## Repository Structure
Each folder represents a standalone concept or mini-project:

- `01_LED_Blink` – Digital output control and timing basics  
- `02_Button_LED` – Digital input handling (upcoming)  
- `03_Sensor_Interfacing` – Analog input and ADC concepts (upcoming)

## Tools & Platforms
- Arduino (Simulation)
- Tinkercad Circuits
- GitHub (version control)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Arduino program structure and embedded C basics  
- Work with digital and analog I/O  
- Build and simulate IoT-ready embedded systems without hardware  
- Maintain clean, version-controlled project documentation

## Notes
All projects are developed using simulations to focus on concepts and logic before deploying on physical hardware.
